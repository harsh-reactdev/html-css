# html-css-fundamentals
This repo contains my practice work on html and css fundamentals that I learnt from a course online.


Through this course, I've acquired knowledge on structuring a website using html while making use of semantic html elements. I have also learnt about box model and fluid layouting using flexbox and grid. The idea of taking up this course was to learn html and css with an absolute fresher mindset. I have got to learn all of these from scratch and I feel a little more wise about html and css after finishing this course.

All the code here will be for other students of the course, to help them if they got stuck in between the course. Have fun and happy learning you all.!
